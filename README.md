Ideas
 - Looking at predictive power of different lacrosse statistics
 - Just look at the number of games you got wrong during the season
 - will have to break it up by weeks likely?
 - ELO
 - RPI
 - RPI but use ML to change the weights?
 - Some other statistic that I come up with?
 - Where is the Hypo Testing?
