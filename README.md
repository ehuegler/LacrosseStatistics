# Lacrosse Statistics

Ideas
 - Looking at predictive power of different lacrosse statistics
 - Just look at the number of games you got wrong during the season
 - will have to break it up by weeks likely?
 - ELO
 - Media Rankings
 - RPI
 - RPI but use ML to change the weights?
 - Some other statistic that I come up with?
 - Where is the Hypo Testing?

 for the 2019 season
 go week to week -> since college lacrosse teams typically play 1 game a week
 calculate the number of games that a particular statistic got right for that season
 then at the end run a hypothesis test to see if any of them had a statistical signifigant difference in how well they predicted
